Seven Valentine Day Heart Confession Effect
This is a simple JavaScript code snippet to create a fullscreen Valentine's Day heart confession effect using HTML5 Canvas. The code renders a heart-shaped curve on the canvas and continuously updates it to create an animated effect.

Usage
To use this effect, simply include the provided index.js file in your HTML document. Ensure that you have a canvas element in your HTML file where the heart effect will be rendered.

html
Copy code
<canvas></canvas>
<script src="index.js"></script>
How it Works
The script utilizes the HTML5 Canvas API to draw a heart-shaped curve. It defines a heartCurve function to generate the heart curve and continuously renders it on the canvas using requestAnimationFrame.

Customization
You can customize the appearance of the heart effect by adjusting parameters such as color, scale, and curve shape directly in the index.js file.
